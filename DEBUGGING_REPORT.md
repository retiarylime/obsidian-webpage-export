# CHUNKED EXPORTER DEBUGGING REPORT

## Current Status
The chunked exporter **should be working** based on our analysis, but files are still being flattened. This suggests one of several possible issues.

## What We Fixed
1. âœ… **findCommonRootPath logic** - Now exactly matches regular exporter
2. âœ… **Global exportRoot calculation** - Calculates from ALL files, not per chunk
3. âœ… **Settings overrides** - Both website.exportOptions and Settings.exportOptions are set
4. âœ… **removeRootFromPath logic** - Already had a fix for empty exportRoot

## Expected Behavior
For Korean vault with mixed subfolders:
- **exportRoot should be:** `""` (empty string)
- **removeRootFromPath should:** Preserve full paths (no stripping)
- **Final output should be:** 
  - `korean/2000-essential-korean-words---beginner-&-intermediate/ê°€ë¦¬í‚¤ë‹¤.html`
  - `korean/korean-grammar-sentences-by-evita/test.html`

## Current Problem
Files are still flattened to root: `ê°€ë¦¬í‚¤ë‹¤.html` instead of preserving directory structure.

## What to Check Next

### 1. Console Output During Export
During the chunked export, you should see these debug messages in the browser console (F12):

```
ðŸ”§ Global export root for all chunks: ""
ðŸ”§ DEBUG: Sample file processing with exportRoot=""
ðŸ”§ DOWNLOADABLE removeRootFromPath called:
   path: "korean/2000-essential-korean-words---beginner-&-intermediate/ê°€ë¦¬í‚¤ë‹¤.html"
   exportRoot: ""
   âœ… Preserving full path for mixed vault: "..."
```

### 2. Possible Issues

**Issue A: exportRoot not empty**
If you see: `exportRoot: "korean"` instead of `exportRoot: ""`, then the findCommonRootPath calculation is wrong.

**Issue B: removeRootFromPath not called**  
If you don't see the "DOWNLOADABLE removeRootFromPath called" messages, then a different code path is being used.

**Issue C: flattenExportPaths enabled**
If you see: `flattenExportPaths: true`, then path flattening is enabled somewhere.

**Issue D: Settings override timing**
The Settings override might be happening after Attachment objects are created.

### 3. Test Instructions

**Stop the current export** and try a **fresh chunked export** with the updated plugin:

1. Open browser console (F12) before starting export
2. Start chunked export 
3. Look for the debug messages above
4. Copy/paste the console output to help us identify the exact issue

### 4. Quick Verification

Run this in the browser console during export:
```javascript
// Check current Settings
console.log("Settings exportRoot:", Settings.exportOptions.exportRoot);
console.log("Settings flattenExportPaths:", Settings.exportOptions.flattenExportPaths);
```

## Likely Solution

Based on the code analysis, I suspect the issue is **timing** - the Settings overrides might not be applied early enough, or there's a different `ExportPipelineOptions` object being used for `Attachment` constructors.

The fix is probably to ensure the global Settings are set **before** any `Website.build()` calls that create Attachment objects.

## Next Steps

1. Check console output during export
2. Verify which debug messages appear
3. Report findings so we can identify the exact code path issue
4. Apply targeted fix based on findings
